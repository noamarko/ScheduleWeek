A program that creates a weekly schedule for swimming pool lessons

The first page - Input student details:

The program takes in an argument (student input details). 
Due to the fact that the swimming lessons are taught by instructors, the program checks 
which day suits the best for the giving student (type of swimming form, days available, private lesson etc.).

The second page - Schedule:

A weekly schedule where all of the students (30 maximum) are listed in the desired lessons.
If a conflict has occurred - a conflict box messeage will appear.
